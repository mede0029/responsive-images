[ X ] Create a HTML file and an external CSS file that shows responsive images using the <picture>, 
<source>, and <img> tags combined with a responsive layout driven by CSS media queries.

As the user adjusts the size of your page two things will happen:

[ X ] 1. The media queries in your CSS file will be altering the layout and the number of columns 
that appear on the page.

[ X ] 2. The media queries in your HTML <source> elements will be choosing the most appropriate 
size image file to load and display.

[ X ] To create a proper image grid that expands as the page is adjusted, use an HTML <ul> plus 
an <li> element for each picture.

Images

[ X ] Download these images - raw-images.zipView in a new window 

[ X ] Each image needs to be re-saved and optimized for the web using either 96 or 72 dpi 
and saved at medium to high quality using a web optimized format

[ X ] Crop and convert each image into three sizes:

Large: 800px width x 600px height - to be used when the page width is greater than 1500px.

Medium: 600px width x 450px height - to be used when the page width is between 700px and 1500px

Small: 400px width x 300px height - to be used when the page width is less than 700px

[ X ] These sizes should be used in your <source> elements.

[ X ] Use the medium size as the default for your <img> elements. 

[ X ] All your <picture> and <img> elements should be given a default max-width of 90% 
so that they can resize to fit their container.

Image Attribution

[ X ] Be sure to add the attribution to your images as a comment in either your CSS or HTML.

Layout

In your webpage there will be 3 layouts. Use percentages to control the width of the 
<li> elements and the margins between them.

[ X ] 1. Less than 600px - one column layout

[ X ] 2. Between 600px and 1200px - two column layout

[ X ] 3. Above 1200px - four column layout

Transitions and Transforms

[ X ] Each image should have a transition and transform applied in CSS

[ X ] The transition property should be your transform which must have a minimum duration of 0.2s 
and must specify a transition-timing-function property such as "ease-in".

[ X ] You can use any tranform you wish:  scale, rotate, translate etc.

[ X ] The transition effect should start with a hover event over any image.

Note: This will be demonstrated in class

Submission

[ X ] Create a GitHub Repository called "responsive-images".

[ X ] Add the gh-pages branch to the responsive-images repo.

[ X ] Save your HTML file as index.html

[ X ] Put your CSS file in a CSS folder and link to it from the HTML file.

[ X ] Put your resized images in a folder called "img".

[ X ] Add the HTML, CSS, and images to your gh-pages branch of your repo.

[ X ] Submit the link to your gh-pages rendered site.
